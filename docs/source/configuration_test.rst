 Test Installation and Configuration
#####################################

For users of any operating system, installation and configuration are deemed successfully if the commands ``make
install`` and ``make configure`` do not return any errors. Installation will also create a ``~/.chemsmart`` containing
the required files. In addition, the paths for chemsmart packages should be correctly added to the user ``~/.bashrc`` or
``~/.zshrc`` file.

Finally, one should be able to run

.. code:: console

   chemsmart --help

to get the options for running chemsmart package.
